The goal of this application is to calculate the network and broadcast address of an ipv4 address and a subnet mask.

After diving into subnetting I wanted to code a way for myself to make the time consuming calculations instant


# Current production

Functioning decimal to binary calculator taking the ip and subnet mask then converting them to binary returning the data on screen
